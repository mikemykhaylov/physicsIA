	abstract = {We have calibrated the effective temperatures of the low main sequence stars ranging spectral types from F0 to K5 versus [Fe/H] and colours (B-V), (R-I), (V-R), (V-I), (V-K), (J-H), (J-K) and ubvy-β, using a large sample of dwarfs and subdwarfs. The effective temperatures, scaled to direct T\_eff\_ determinations via reliable angular diameter measurements, were derived applying the {InfraRed} Flux Method with the new grid of atmosphere models developed by Kurucz (1993). We have fitted polynomial functions of the form θ\_eff\_=P(colour,[Fe/H]) using the least squares method. The precision of the fits ranges from 30K for (V-K) to 154K for (J-H). The new relations have been compared to previous calibrations. We also provide the empirical intrinsic colours (U-B), (B-V), (R-I), (V-R), (V-I), (V-K), (J-H), (J-K) and β, in the ranges: 4000K{\textless}T\_eff\_{\textless}8000K and 0{\textgreater}[Fe/H]{\textgreater}-2.5.},

	abstract = {Multiple quantum wells ({MQWs}) are incorporated in the current limiting middle subcell of standard {InGaP}/{InGaAs}/Ge multi-junction solar cell ({MJSC}). Considering a realistic radiation dose in geo-stationary orbits (1 {MeV} electron irradiation-1 × 1016 cm−2 fluence), carrier lifetime is calculated and defined in the top cell and middle subcell region. The thermionic emission and recombination lifetimes are taken into consideration while defining lifetime in the middle {MQW} region. The physical thickness of quantum well ({QW}) and quantum barrier ({QB}) are slightly adjusted to numerically satisfy the strain balancing condition and to achieve higher efficiency at 1-sun ({AM}0 spectrum). In addition to interface recombination, carrier removal effects were taken into consideration by changing the intrinsic region in the {PiN} middle subcell into n-type. With the nonidealities taken into consideration, the proposed device exhibits an efficiency of 32\% at 1-sun {AM}0 radiation and a peak efficiency of 37.63\% at concentrated sunlight. Trap concentration of 1 × 1017 cm−3 in top cell with 10 ns lifetime defined in the middle cell emitter, base and {MQW} region is obtained as threshold point beyond which the device exhibits significant degradation.},

astronomical objects. It contains identifications, ``basic data'',
bibliography, and selected observational measurements for several
million astronomical objects. Simbad is developed and maintained by {CDS},
Strasbourg. Building the database contents is achieved with the help of
several contributing institutes. Scanning the bibliography is the result
of the collaboration of {CDS} with bibliographers in Observatoire de Paris
({DASGAL}), Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, and Observatoire de
Bordeaux. When selecting catalogues and tables for inclusion, priority
is given to optimal multi-wavelength coverage of the database, and to
support of research developments linked to large projects. In parallel,
the systematic scanning of the bibliography reflects the diversity and
general trends of astronomical research. A {WWW} interface to Simbad is
available at: \{http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/Simbad\}.},
